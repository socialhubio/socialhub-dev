The SocialHub Manifest API allows the manipulation of Channel Manifests. Manifests are automatically created for [Custom Channels](../integration#a-custom-channel) and define a Network's capabilities and configures communication with its Integration. A Custom Channel will start off with an empty default Manifest which should be adjusted as needed by the Integration.

Once a Manifest has been promoted to being ["Reusable"](../integration#b-reusable-manifest) it will appear as an available Network to Customers allowing the creation of additional Channels using the same configuration.

## Updating Manifests

Manifests can be partially updated using the REST API route `PATCH /manifest`.

The Manifest that should be updated is identified by looking up the Channel specified in the JWT. Note that once a Manifest has been promoted, it is currently no longer possible to update it without contacting the SocialHub Team.

Also take a look at the [Swagger API Reference](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/socialhubio/socialhub-dev/master/swagger.yaml).

### Responses

The following error responses should the handled by the Integration's client:

#### `HTTP 200 OK`

Returns the successfully updated Manifest object.

If the request body was empty (`{}`) nothing was updated and the current Manifest is simply returned in full.

#### `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity`

```json
{
  "code": "WebhookValidationError",
  "message": "Error: An error occurred while attempting to validate the WebHook",
  "data": "Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND socialhub.example.com socialhub.example.com:443"
}
```

Is returned whenever the WebHook URL specified in the Manifest is not reachable by the HTTPS test request. The `data` value is the internal error that occurred when the test was attempted and should help debugging the issue.

It's also possible that we were able to execute the HTTPS request but the response did not contain a valid challenge response header:

```json
{
  "code": "WebhookValidationError",
  "message": "Error: The WebHook failed to solve the challenge"
}
```

Or that the SSL certificate the WebHook is hosted with is no longer valid:

```
{
  "code": "WebhookValidationError",
  "message": "Error: An error occurred while attempting to validate the WebHook",
  "data": "Error: certificate has expired"
}
```

## Callbacks

### Channel Creation

Is required to be set for Reusable Manifests in `callbacks.channelCreation`. SocialHub will redirect users clicking on the "Add Channel" Button of a Reusable Manifest Network to this URL with a special temporary JWT (as `?token=` query parameter) that can only be used for the Channel creation route.

This JWT has the following payload:

```javascript
{
  "accountId": "5c9b6b2a58a855074d1d278f",  // Id of the Account the token belongs to
  "manifestId": "5e73f56c5a45da10b6e614dd", // Id of the Manifest the User wants to create channels for
  "userId": "5e73f5255a45da10b6e614da",     // Id of the User wanting to create channels
  "origin": "https://app.socialhub.io",     // URL of the SocialHub platform to redirect back to
  "iat": 1554134541,                        // Timestamp in seconds of the token issuing date
  "exp": 1554136341                         // Timestamp in seconds of the token expiration date (30 mins)
}
```

### Channel Reactivation

May be set for Reusable Manifests in `callbacks.channelReactivation`. SocialHub will redirect users wanting to reactivate a disabled Channel belonging the Integration's Reusable Manifest to this URL with a special temporary JWT (as `?token=` query parameter) that can only be used for the Channel creation route (which is also used for reactivating Channels).

This JWT has the following payload:

```javascript
{
  "accountId": "5c9b6b2a58a855074d1d278f",  // Id of the Account the token belongs to
  "manifestId": "5e73f56c5a45da10b6e614dd", // Id of the Manifest the User wants to create channels for
  "userId": "5e73f5255a45da10b6e614da",     // Id of the User wanting to create channels
  "origin": "https://app.socialhub.io",     // URL of the SocialHub platform to redirect back to
  "channelId": "5c9c01952bdfd718307a0a53",  // Id of the Channel that should be reactivated
  "uniqueName": "test",                     // Unique name of the Channel
  "networkId": "39272404",                  // Unique network ID of the Channel (optional)
  "iat": 1554134541,                        // Timestamp in seconds of the token issuing date
  "exp": 1554136341                         // Timestamp in seconds of the token expiration date (30 mins)
}
```

### Templates

Ticket Actions of type `template_reply` require a callback URL to be set (`inbox.ticketActions[].config.templates.url`) from where a list of available templates are fetched from.

The ID of the Channel the templates are requested for will be passed as `?channelId=` query parameter. For additional security the request will be [signed the same way a WebHook](../webhooks#verification) request would be.

This callback URL should return templates and their variables following this example:

```javascript
[{
  // Human readable name of the template to display to the SocialHub user.
  "name": "Test Greeting",
  // Machine identifier of the template.
  "networkId": "test_greeting",
  // Variables the user may fill out for this template (json schema format).
  "variables": {
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 2,
      "maxLength": 12
    }
  },
  // Text templates used for previewing message (handlebars format).
  "text": {
    "en": "Hello {{firstName}}",
    "de": "Hallo {{firstName}}",
    "fr": "Bienvenue {{firstName}}"
  }
}]
```

The `networkId` of the Template the user selected and the values the variables have been filled with, will be sent as part of the [`ticket_action` event payload](../inbox/ticket-api#ticket-action-type-template-reply) once the `template_reply` Action has been submitted.
